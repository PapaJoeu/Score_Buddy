Kev's Bitchin Print Calculator
Introduction

Welcome to Kev's Bitchin Print Calculator! This nifty tool is born out of the daily grind of operating cutting and folding machines. As a production worker learning to code, I've realized coding is a lot like printing—it's all about math. This project aims to give you quick answers and visual examples for those pesky layout problems we encounter every day.
Features

    Calculate Layout: Figure out how many documents fit on a sheet with a click.
    Score Layout: Determine score positions for bifold and trifold documents, with or without margins.
    Rotate Dimensions: Swap width and length of your documents or sheets easily.
    Custom Sizes: Input any custom dimensions for sheets, documents, and gutters.
    Visual Representation: See your layout on a canvas for better understanding.

How to Use
Setting Up Sheet Dimensions

    Select a Standard Size: Click one of the standard sheet size buttons (e.g., 12x18, 13x19).
    Custom Size: Need something special? Click "Custom" and manually input the width and length.

Setting Up Document Dimensions

    Select a Standard Size: Click one of the document size buttons (e.g., Business Card, Letter).
    Custom Size: Click "Custom" and enter the width and length yourself.

Setting Up Gutter Sizes

    Select a Standard Size: Click one of the gutter size buttons (e.g., 1/8, 1/4).

    Use "Rotate Sheet" to swap the width and length of the sheet.
    The layout will automatically recalculate after rotation.

Visual Representation

The layout is displayed on a canvas for easy visualization. Documents are arranged on the sheet with margins and gutters clearly shown. Each document is labeled for easy identification.
Example

Here's an example to get you started:

    Select a sheet size of 12x18.
    Select a document size of 3.5x2 (Business Card).
